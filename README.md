# Task_2_Prediction_using_Unsupervised_ML
## OBJECTIVE

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

## ALGORITHM 

K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid.
